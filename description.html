    <h1>What is Lua?</h1>
        <p>Lua is a scripting language that prides itself on its speed. The language is embeddable and supports procedural, object-oriented, functional, 
        and data-driven programming as well as data description. The language also has variants that you can choose to use.</p>
    <h1>Where is Lua used?</h1>
        <p>Lua is used in several industrial applications and used especially with embedded systems. It is currently the leading scripting language for 
        games even winning the Front Line Award in 2011 from the Game Developers Magazine. Even for games or apps primarily coded in other language 
        its common to see them use lua for mods or extensions. Examples for where Lua has been used are as follows
            <ul>
                Adobe's Photoshop Lightroom
                World of Warcraft
                Angry Birds
                Roblox
                Garry's Mod
                Project Zomboid
                Factorio
                Friday Night Funkin'
                MySQL Workbench
                Scrap Mechanic
                Warframe
            </ul>
        </p>
    <h1>Lua's Advantages</h1>
        <h3>Speed</h3>
            <p>Several benchmarks show Lua as the fastest interpeted scripting language. It is also known that an aspiration of scripting languages are to 
            be "as fast as Lua" as it has built a reputation on performance. Significant portions of larger applications have been in Lua. If you want 
            more speedm they recommend to use LuaJIT which is an independent implementation that uses a just-in-time compiler.</p>
        <h3>Portability</h3>
            <p>The language is distributed in a small package that builds out-of-the-box on any platform that has a standard C compiler. This means it runs 
            across the flavors of Unix and Windows as well as Android, iOS, BREW, Symbian, and Windows Phone. Embedded microprocessors like ARM and Rabbit 
            can use it like with Lego Mindstorms.</p>
        <h3>Embeddable</h3>
            <p>Lua has a small footprint and well documented API that allows it to nearly seemlessly integrate with code in other languages whether its 
            calling from alternative languages and vice-versa. Lua can be extended with libraries from other languages. Lua has been used to extend programs 
            written even in other scripting languages.</p>
        <h3>Powerful</h3>
            <p>A fundamental concept behind Lua is using meta-mechanisms to implement features instead of providing features directly for the language. Lua 
            is not a pure object-oriented language but it uses meta-mechanisms for implementation of classes and inheritance, these systems allow the 
            language to have a large "economy" of concepts while keeping the language small. Semantics can then be extended in a variety of unconventional 
            ways.</p>
        <h3>Small</h3>
            <p>Adding Lua to an application does not significantly increase its size which also helps with security. The tarball is 365K and 1.3M 
            uncompressed. The interpreter is 279K and the library 464K.</p>
        <h3>Free</h3>
            <p>Lua is a free open source language. It uses a very liberal license that is also known as the MIT license. It may be used for any purpose at 
            no cost.</p>
    <h1>Additional Information</h1>
    <p>

            The name Lua comes from the Portuguese word for moon
            Lua is designed and maintained by at team at PUC-Rio in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil
