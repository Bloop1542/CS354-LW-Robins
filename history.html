  <h1>What is Lua?</h1>
  <p>Lua is a scripting language that prides itself on its speed. The language is embeddable and supports procedural, object-oriented, functional, 
  and data-driven programming as well as data description.</p>

  <h1>History of Lua</h1>
  <p>Lua was created in 1993 by Roberto Ierusalimschy, Luiz Henrique de Figueiredo, and Waldemar Celes, members of the Computer Graphics Technology Group (TeCGraf) at PUC-Rio in Brazil. Lua evolved from internal languages like SOL and DEL, and by version 5.0 in 2003, it introduced a standalone interpreter and virtual machine. Lua has since been adopted globally, especially in games and embedded systems.</p>

  <h1>Where is Lua used?</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Adobe Lightroom</li>
    <li>World of Warcraft (UI mods)</li>
    <li>Roblox</li>
    <li>Garry's Mod</li>
    <li>Project Zomboid</li>
    <li>Factorio</li>
    <li>Friday Night Funkin'</li>
    <li>MySQL Workbench</li>
    <li>Warframe</li>
  </ul>

  <h1>Lua's Advantages</h1>

  <h3>Speed</h3>
  <p>Lua is often the fastest interpreted scripting language in benchmarks. LuaJIT boosts performance even more with just-in-time compilation.</p>

  <h3>Portability</h3>
  <p>Lua is small and compiles on virtually any system with a C compiler. It's used across Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, embedded chips, and even Lego Mindstorms.</p>

  <h3>Embeddable</h3>
  <p>Lua integrates easily with other languages using a small, clean API. It's frequently used to embed scripting into C/C++ applications.</p>

  <h3>Powerful</h3>
  <p>Lua uses meta-mechanisms rather than hardcoded features, making it flexible. While not class-based by default, it supports object-oriented design patterns.</p>

  <h3>Small</h3>
  <p>The full Lua distribution is tiny—just a few hundred kilobytes. This makes it ideal for performance-sensitive and embedded applications.</p>

  <h3>Free</h3>
  <p>Lua is free open-source software under the MIT license, meaning you can use it for any purpose without cost.</p>
